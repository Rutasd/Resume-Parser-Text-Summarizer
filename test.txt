To overcome this, a system can be developed which detects the number plate, generates a bill, deducts it through an app directly. This can save a lot of time and other problems faced in these situations. At the exit point the same vehicle is detected again and time for which the vehicle was parked is seen. The bill amount is generated according to this time and deducted directly from the registered account in the ‘PayPark’ app. This app provides an easy-to-use interface for user to handle his account and car details on the go. As the name suggests, the project so developed is useful in theatres, shopping complexes, malls, railway stations, airports and any other places that provide vehicle parking facilities.
